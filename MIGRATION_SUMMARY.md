streamlit run streamlit_app.py
# or
python run_dashboard.py
```

**Legacy Method (Still Supported):**
```bash
python forex_bot.py --gui
```

### For Developers

The migration was designed to:
- **Preserve all functionality** from the Tkinter GUI
- **Maintain backward compatibility** (Tkinter still available)
- **Improve code maintainability** (cleaner Streamlit code)
- **Enable future enhancements** (easier to extend)

## Technical Details

### Files Added
- `streamlit_app.py` - Main Streamlit application (443 lines)
- `run_dashboard.py` - Helper launcher script
- `STREAMLIT_GUIDE.md` - User documentation
- `STREAMLIT_UI.md` - UI visualization
- `test_streamlit.py` - Test suite

### Files Modified
- `forex_bot.py` - Added Streamlit mode support
- `requirements.txt` - Added streamlit dependency
- `README.md` - Updated with Streamlit instructions

### Files Preserved
- `forex_gui.py` - Legacy Tkinter GUI still available

## Code Quality

### Tkinter GUI (`forex_gui.py`)
- 342 lines of code
- Procedural style
- Tightly coupled to Tk widgets
- Manual state management

### Streamlit Dashboard (`streamlit_app.py`)
- 443 lines of code
- Declarative style
- Clean separation of concerns
- Built-in state management

### Advantages
- **Better readability**: Streamlit code is more intuitive
- **Easier testing**: Web-based testing tools available
- **Simpler debugging**: Browser dev tools accessible
- **More extensible**: Adding features is straightforward

## Performance

### Tkinter
- Starts immediately (desktop app)
- No network overhead
- Limited to desktop performance

### Streamlit
- Starts in 2-3 seconds (web server)
- Minimal network overhead (localhost)
- Leverages browser optimization

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
```
✓ PASSED: Imports
✓ PASSED: Structure  
✓ PASSED: Helper Scripts
✓ PASSED: Requirements
✓ PASSED: Integration
```

## User Feedback Considerations

### Potential User Concerns
1. **"I prefer desktop apps"**
   - Solution: Tkinter GUI still available with `--gui` flag
   
2. **"What about offline access?"**
   - Solution: Streamlit runs locally, no internet needed
   
3. **"Is it secure?"**
   - Solution: Runs on localhost by default, not exposed to network

### Expected Benefits
1. **"Love the modern UI"** - Professional appearance
2. **"Auto-refresh is great"** - No manual updates needed
3. **"Works on my tablet"** - Mobile-friendly design
4. **"Easier to use"** - Intuitive navigation

## Future Enhancements
